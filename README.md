# GenericGecko

Generic USB Gecko client for Windows, displays a console output and supports
uploading files via Wiiload (and mini's upload protocol, in theory.)

Made this a few years ago, decided to release but it's not really fit for casual
use. You have to edit Program.cs to change which COM port your USB Gecko is
assigned to.
